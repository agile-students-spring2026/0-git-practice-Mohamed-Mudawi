## What I Found Interesting
I find this article interesting because LLMs affect almost every aspect of the software engineering industry today. In my opinion, if you are working at a big tech company and are not using an LLM to speed up your work, then you're behind a lot of other engineers. And I think the same can be said about college; if you're not asking LLMs to help understand and guide you in your coursework, then you're at a disadvantage. Of course, I do not condone using LLMs to complete your work, but there are things that LLMs are useful for, such as searching up something in a textbook, which could otherwise take hours. But I do agree with the fact that overusing LLMs is a dangerous thing because then it makes you easily replaceable, as an engineer. I think there needs to be a balance between how much you are using LLMs versus how much you abstain.

This article made me think about how relying too heavily on LLMs could weaken engineers’ problem-solving and critical thinking skills, and personally I worry that if developers depend on AI to write and explain everything, it could reduce creativity and make the field feel less driven by genuine understanding and craftsmanship. But yes the points written by is definitely true, if you are not using LLMs you are at an disadvantage which is hard to curb, since someone using LLMs will always be faster than one not.
